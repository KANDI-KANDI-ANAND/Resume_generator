# 🚀 AI Resume Optimizer (Agentic AI Resume Generator)

An **Agentic** AI-powered resume optimization system that analyzes a candidate's resume against a job description and automatically generates an ATS-optimized resume.  
This system uses a LangGraph multi-node pipeline to parse resumes, analyze skill gaps, plan improvements, rewrite the resume, validate ATS compatibility, and generate a professional PDF resume output.  
The project also includes a Streamlit UI that allows users to upload their resume, provide a job description through a chat interface, and download an optimized resume.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements an Agentic AI architecture using LangGraph where each step of the resume optimization pipeline is handled by a specialized node.

The system performs the following steps:

- Resume Parsing  
- Skill Extraction  
- Job Description Analysis  
- Skill Matching  
- Gap Analysis  
- Resume Improvement Planning  
- Resume Rewriting  
- ATS Score Validation  
- PDF Resume Generation  

The final result is a structured, ATS-optimized resume in PDF format.
